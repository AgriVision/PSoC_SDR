# PSoC_SDR
Stand Alone SDR Receiver using PSoC 5LP

PSoC is an ideal platform to built a software defined radio (SDR), without relying on a PC for the SDR processing! 
Some years ago Simple circuits build one using the PSoC 3 (http://www.simplecircuits.com/SimpleRadios.html). 
Currently their hardware is'n available anymore. This is the software for using the PSoC 5LP Kit to built a SDR design similar to simplecircuits.
